## Musical Typing

Small experiment to create a react wrapper for [Vexflow](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki), a musical engraving library.

### Goals
One potential goal of the project is to 'encrypt' messages and conceal the encryption in music notation.

With a tool like this you could arbitrarily produce sheets of music notation, which could be used as an aid for composition. One immediate use is in creating a musical cryptogram using ones name.

### Todos
* Enable dynamic note duration caclulations.
* Address the one bar per stave inefficiency.
* Create instrument components (currently there is only a stave component)
